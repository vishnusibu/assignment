#Numbers
#Write an equation that uses multiplication, division, an exponent, addition, and subtraction that is equal to 100.25.
#Hint: This is just to test your memory of the basic arithmetic commands, work backwards from 100.25

#Strings
#Given the string 'hello' give an index command that returns 'e'. Enter your code in the cell below:

# Method 1:
print(s1[4])
# Method 2:

#Lists
#Build this list [0,0,0] two separate ways.
