#Arithmetic Operators:
  #1 . What is the result of 7 + 4?
print(7+4)
  #2. Calculate the value of 12 - 5.
print(12-5)
  #3 . Multiply 3 by 8 using which operator.
print(3*8)
  #4 . Divide 15 by 3 using the / operator.
print(15/3)
  #5 . Find the remainder when 20 is divided by 7 using the % operator.
print(20%7)
  #6 . What is the result of 2 ** 3?
print(2**3)
#Assignment Operators:

  #1 . Given x = 10, update the value of x by adding 5 using an assignment operator.
x=10
x+=5
print(x)
  #2 . If y = 15, use an assignment operator to subtract 3 from y.
y=15
y-=3
print(y)
  #3 . Starting with z = 6, apply a multiplication assignment operator to make z equal to 36.
z=6
z*=6
print(z)


#Comparison Operators:

  #1 . Check if a is equal to b where a = 7 and b = 7.
a=7
b=7
print(a==b)

  #2 . Determine if x is not equal to y when x = 5 and y = 8.
x=5
y=8
print(x!=y)

  #3 . Verify if m is greater than n given that m = 20 and n = 15.
m=20
n=15
print(m>n)

  #4 . Check if p is less than or equal to q where p = 10 and q = 10.
p=10
q=10
print(p<=q)

  #5 . Compare whether r is greater than or equal to s with r = 25 and s = 30.
r=25
s=30
print(r>=s)

  #6 . Is t less than u if t = 12 and u = 15?
t=12
u=15
print(t<u)
